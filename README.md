An internet radio app for ios can support Apple CarPlay

I regret to inform you that the development of the Internet radio application intended for Apple CarPlay has been halted. After initiating the project and successfully creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the iPhone version, I've come to the decision to discontinue its progression.

Unfortunately, I discovered that developing an application for CarPlay requires obtaining permission from Apple and persuading them regarding the functionality and utility of the application. This process involves satisfying specific criteria set forth by Apple, making it a more complex and challenging endeavor than initially anticipated.

Considering the intricacies involved in obtaining Apple's approval for CarPlay integration and the limitations on personal resources and time, I have decided not to proceed further with this project.

Best regards,
